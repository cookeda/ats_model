    Writes a dictionary to a JSON file.

    This function takes a dictionary and writes it to a specified JSON file. It ensures that the JSON data is formatted
    with an indentation of 4 spaces, making it more readable.

    Parameters:
    data (dict): The dictionary containing the data to be written to the JSON file.
    file_path (str): The path to the JSON file where the data will be written. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

    Combines data from multiple JSON files into a single dictionary.

    This function reads each JSON file specified in the file_paths list, combines their contents into a single dictionary,

    This behavior might need adjustment based on specific requirements for handling key conflicts.

    Parameters:
    file_paths (list of str): A list of strings, where each string is a path to a JSON file to be combined.
